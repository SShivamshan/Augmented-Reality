# Augmented-Reality

**Project Description :**  

For our computer vision course, we were tasked in creating a programm capable of projecting a 2D image in 3D using the basics of computer vision such as intrinsic, homography and projection matrices but at the same time we also have to take into account the perpective in which the image is taken, then noises that could possible appear when taking a photo etc... In order to do so, we will use the Computer Vision Toolbox, a module that has necessary tools to finalize the project.  

**Language used :** Matlab and Computer Vision Toolbox  

**The PDF file containing all the explanations for the implementation is available : CR_SIVANESAN_KINGSTON_Groupe_2.pdf**
