# Augmented-Reality

**Project Description :**  

For our computer vision course, we were tasked in creating a programm capable of projecting a 2D image in 3D using the basics of computer vision such as intrinsic, homography and projection matrices but at the same time we also have to take into account the perspective in which the image is taken, then noises that could possible appear when taking a photo etc... In order to do so, we will use the Computer Vision Toolbox, a module that has necessary tools to finalize the project.  

**Language used :** Matlab and Computer Vision Toolbox  

**The PDF file contains all the explanations for the implementation done for this project is available under the name: CR_SIVANESAN_KINGSTON_Groupe_2.pdf**

Examples : This example is what we get through edges of the square defined by the user:

The following example is what we get when we detect automatically the center points of the cercle in order to create the cube:
